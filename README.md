# Social-Distancing-Cap-using-IOT
This project presents a simulation using electronic components and IoT to maintain social distancing. In this pandemic it is very important to maintain social distance of at least 122 cm( 4 feet ) to prevent corona virus. The proposed system help us to maintain social distancing using the ultrasonic sensor and the Arduino Uno. In this simulation of social distancing cap, ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between two people and if the distance is less than 122 cm it will give alert by producing low frequency buzzer sound and by glowing orange LED. Apart from this, when the object is very near to the sensor (distance less than 80 cm) it will give alert by producing high frequency buzzer sound and by glowing red LED.So the proposed simulation will give us two types of alert which help us to maintain social distancing.
